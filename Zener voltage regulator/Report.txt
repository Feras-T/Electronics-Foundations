Introduction

This is a demonstration of the capability of regulating voltage using Zener Diode
The Zener diode reverse voltage is (3.3V) and as know it will maintain with this value even when a change in voltage occur.
For this demonstration  A load is connected parallel with Zener and the goal it to see the output voltage in the load, whether it will change if the main power supply change or not.
The schematics of the circuit is shown below

The design of the circuit is show below
[real circuit.pic]

the voltage from power supply is set to 15V and the output voltage in the Zener and the load is 3.31V as shown in figure below
[set.pic]
the power source voltage value increased 1V (from 15-16v) and we see the output voltage in the Zener and the load increased just 0.04V.
[voltage 16v.pic]
until the voltage reaches 25V (increased 10v) and yet the output voltage in the Zener diode and the load changed just ~0.3V as shown below.
[25v.pic]
Now for lower power supply has been set from 15V - 3.31V Zener voltage to 10V and we got ~3.1V in output that's mean 5V drop from the source leaded only 0.3V drop in the Zener output.

conclusion
The Zener diode as roughly could works as a regulator, also as shown in the experiments the Zener regulator regulating better in higher voltage the lower voltage.
